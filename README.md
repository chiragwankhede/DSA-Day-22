🔍 Linear Search and Array Operations in C++: Concepts and Examples

Hey everyone! 👋 I'm excited to share a comprehensive guide on applying Linear Search to find a specific element in an array, interpreting the output, finding the minimum and maximum numbers, and printing extreme elements in an array using C++. The code examples are split into four different files for better organization.

Contents:
1. Linear Search in C++:
    - Applying Linear Search to find a specific element (key) in an array (arr)
    - Interpreting the output of the program
2. Finding Minimum and Maximum Numbers in an Array:
    - Code examples and explanations
3. Printing Extreme Elements in an Array:
    - Code examples and explanations

Why This Matters:
Understanding basic array operations and search algorithms in C++ is fundamental for anyone learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This knowledge will help you write more efficient code and perform well in technical interviews.

Repository Structure:
- `linear_search.cpp`: Contains the code for linear search and interpreting the output.
- `find_min_max.cpp`: Contains the code for finding minimum and maximum numbers in an array.
- `print_extremes.cpp`: Contains the code for printing extreme elements in an array.
- `README.md`: This readme file explaining the purpose and usage of the code files.

How to Use:
- Explore the code examples in the respective files to understand the basics of array operations in C++.
- Use these examples as a reference for your own projects and studies.

Feel free to star ⭐️ and fork 🍴 the repository to keep these resources handy. Contributions and discussions are welcome!

Let's empower each other with knowledge and ace those interviews! 💪

Happy coding! 💻✨
